# Python can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes 
# ("...") with the same result

print( 'spam eggs')  # single quotes
# 'spam eggs'
print( 'doesn\'t')  # use \' to escape the single quote...
# "doesn't"
print( "doesn't")  # ...or use double quotes instead
# "doesn't"
print( '"Yes," they said.')

print( "\"Yes,\" they said.")

print( '"Isn\'t," they said.')

s = 'First line.\nSecond line.'  # \n means newline
print(s)  # with print(), \n produces a new line
# First line.
# Second line.

print("===============================")

# If you donâ€™t want characters prefaced by \ to be interpreted
# as special characters, you can use raw strings by adding an r 
# before the first quote:

print('C:\some\name')  # here \n means newline!
# C:\some
# ame
print(r'C:\some\name')  # note the r before the quote
# C:\some\name

# String literals can span multiple lines. One way is 
# using triple-quotes: """...""" or '''...'''.
