When bacon() returns, the local scope for that call is destroyed. 
The program execution continues in the spam() function to print 
the value of eggs ‚ù∏, and since the local scope for the call to 
spam() still exists here, the eggs variable is set to 99. This 
is what the program prints.

We use global keyword to read and write a global variable inside a function.
Use of global keyword outside a function has no effect

The nonlocal keyword is used to work with variables inside 
nested functions, where the variable should not belong to

Use the keyword nonlocal to declare that the variable is not local.

Nonlocal variable are used in nested function whose local 
scope is not defined. This means, the variable can be neither 
in the local nor the global scope.
