#f-String
# To use formatted string literals, begin a string with f or F 
# before the opening quotation mark or triple quotation mark. 
# Inside this string, you can write a Python expression between 
# { and } characters that can refer to variables or literal values.

# The value of pi is approximately 3.142.

# Passing an integer after the ':' will cause that field to be a 
# minimum number of characters wide. This is useful for making 
# columns line up.
